## Description

A Terraform script to deploy an Acitve-Passive (A-P) HA cluster in a single Zone. This template makes use of the FortiGate IBM SDN connector to failover in the event of a VM shutdown.
After the Active VM is brought back up, it will take over as active once again.

## Requirements

-   [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) 0.13+
-   Two FortiOS 7.0 BYOL Licenses.
-   A VPC with four subnets in a single zone.
-   An IBM ssh key configured.
-   A security group

## Deployment overview

> **Note:** For a local deployment a Gen 2 API key will be needed. For details see: [IBM Gen 2 API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform?topic=terraform-provider-reference)

Terraform deploys the following components:

-   Two FortiGate BYOL instances with four NICs, one in each subnet
-   Three Floating Public IPs: One attached to the Primary FortiGate on Port1, which will failover. One attached, per FortiGate to the HA management port (Port4).
-   A Logging disk per FortiGate
-   A basic bootstrap config, with HA support.
